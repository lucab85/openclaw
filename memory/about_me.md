# about_me.md
# Stable personal + work context for consistent outputs.

## Identity
Name: Luca
Role: Strategy & Product Builder (consulting + venture building)
Timezone: Europe/Rome
Working hours: Mon–Fri 09:00–18:00
Primary language: English

## Operating style (how I like output)
- Default output: concise bullet points
- Prefer: options + recommendation + next steps
- Avoid: filler, repeating the prompt, long essays
- When uncertain: label assumptions and ask up to 2 questions
- Always include: "What I need from you" if execution is blocked

## Goals (current quarter)
1) Ship a practical OpenClaw course and templates people can reuse
2) Build a repeatable daily execution system (brief + actions)
3) Improve reliability and safety of agent workflows (guardrails first)

## Priorities (ranked)
1) Quality of output (useful, actionable, not generic)
2) Safety (least privilege, no risky actions without confirmation)
3) Speed (fast iteration, minimal setup)

## Active projects
### Project A — Udemy OpenClaw course
- Objective: publish a 1-hour practical course
- Success metric: learners complete setup + ship 1 automation
- Constraints: must be safe-by-default; avoid secrets on camera

### Project B — Daily execution workflow
- Objective: daily brief + action queue delivered as a draft email
- Success metric: 10 minutes/day to review and execute
- Constraints: no auto-send; human confirmation required

## Preferences (tools + workflows)
- Email: prefer draft-first, never auto-send
- Chat: private channel only for posting (if used)
- Files: keep memory/skills in a repo; no sensitive data in memory
- Output formatting: max 12 bullets for brief, max 8 actions

## Boundaries
- No financial actions.
- No contacting people outside my org without explicit approval.
- No destructive commands.
- No storing secrets in memory.
