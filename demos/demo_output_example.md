### Outcome
Today's focus: ship the 1-hour OpenClaw course with a working demo + safety guardrails.

### Daily Brief
- Priorities (Top 3):
  1) Record Lectures 2–5 (deploy, memory, tools, daily brief skill)
  2) Package templates (about_me, operating_rules, skill scaffold) into repo structure
  3) Build promo demo: daily brief delivered as a draft email (not sent)
- Risks / blockers:
  - Time risk: recording overhead expands unless scripts are tight
  - Safety risk: accidentally showing keys on screen
- Opportunities:
  - Differentiation: "production-shaped + guardrails" angle vs setup-only courses

### Action Queue
| # | Action | Owner | Effort | Next step | Confidence |
|---|--------|-------|--------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | Finalize course outline timestamps | Luca | S | Lock minute-by-minute plan | High |
| 2 | Record deploy lecture with Docker | Luca | M | Capture clean terminal run | High |
| 3 | Add memory files + test prompts | Luca | S | Paste templates + validate behavior | High |
| 4 | Connect search tool + run 1 query | Luca | M | Screen-record successful tool call | Med |
| 5 | Implement run_daily_brief skill | Luca | M | Demo: output contract respected | High |
| 6 | Add "draft-only" delivery | Luca | S | Create draft email; no auto-send | High |
| 7 | Create checklist slide (guardrails) | Luca | S | Summarize secrets + injection + confirm | High |

### Assumptions
- Assumption: email tool supports draft-only mode (if not, use local output + manual paste).

### What I need from you
- Which delivery channel do you prefer for the demo: email draft or private chat draft?
- Any specific focus area you want the brief to track daily (customers, product metrics, ops)?
